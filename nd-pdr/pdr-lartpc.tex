\subsection{Design Parameters}
\label{sec:lartpc-ovvw-param}

The \dword{ndlar} is designed to meet the physics requirements of the \dword{dune} experiment. 
The important design parameters are given in Table~\ref{tab:table-ndlar-params}.

\section{Interfaces}
\label{sec:lartpc-interface}

Table~\ref{tbl:larndinterfaces} contains a summary and brief description of all the interfaces between the \dword{ndlar} consortium and other consortia, working groups, and task forces, with references to the current version of the interface documents describing those interfaces.  
Drawings of the mechanical interfaces and diagrams of the electrical interfaces are 
included in the interface documents as appropriate.
It is expected that further refinements of the interface documents will take place prior to the final \dword{prr} for the detector. The interface documents specify the responsibility of different consortia or groups during all phases of the experiment including design and prototyping, integration,  installation, and  commissioning.

\section{Risks and Mitigations}
\label{sec:lartpc-risks}

Table~\ref{tab:risks:ND-LAr} contains a list of all the
risks that \dword{dune} is currently holding in the \dword{ndlar} risk register.  Each line includes the official \dword{dune} risk register identification number, a description of the risk, the proposed mitigation for the risk, and finally three columns rating the post-mitigation (P)robability that the risk described comes to pass, the degree of (C)ost risk for that line, and the degree of (S)chedule risk.  Risk levels are defined as (L)ow (<10\% probability of occurring, <5\% cost impact, <2 month schedule impact), (M)edium (10 to 25\% probability of occurring, 5\% to 20\% cost impact, 2 to 6 month schedule impact), or (H)igh (>25\% probability of occurring, >20\% cost impact, >6 month schedule impact).  Most of these risks are reduced to a ``Low'' level following mitigation (as shown in the table), although several of them currently hold a higher risk levels (pre-mitigation), due to the early stage of development of the \dword{ndlar} system relative to other systems.  

In the following sections, we present a narrative description of each of the risks and the proposed mitigation.

\section{Schedule}
\label{sec:lartpc-org-sched}

Table \ref{tab:ndlar-sched} lists key milestones in the design, validation, construction, and installation of the \dword{ndlar}.  These milestones include external milestones indicating linkages to the main \dword{dune} schedule (highlighted in color in the table), as well as internal milestones such as design validation and technical reviews.
